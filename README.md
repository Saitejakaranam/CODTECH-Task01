Overview Of The Project

Project: Simple Calculator using java
This project aims to create a basic functional calculator application using Java and the JavaFX framework. This simple calculator serves as a foundation for building more complex calculators in the future, potentially including features like memory functions, scientific operations, or advanced formatting.

Key Activities
-->Designing user interface.
-->Error Handling.
-->Implementing button functionality.

Technologies Used
Java:
•	Java is the primary programming language used to develop the application logic.
•	It allows for creating classes, objects, methods, and leveraging Java's built-in functionalities for mathematical operations, string manipulation, and user input handling.
JavaFX:
•	JavaFX is a graphical user interface (GUI) framework built on top of Java.
•	It provides the tools to design the visual elements like the display label and buttons, as well as manage their layout and interactions.
•	In this project, JavaFX classes like Label, Button, GridPane, and Scene are used to construct the calculator's user interface.
Scene Builder:
 Scene Builder is a helpful tool included with JavaFX. It allows you to visually design the user interface (UI) by dragging and dropping UI components, setting properties, and previewing the layout in real-time. This can significantly improve the development workflow for designing the calculator's interface.
Even though Scene Builder is optional, it's a widely used tool for JavaFX development and can significantly enhance the development experience, especially when dealing with complex user interfaces.
